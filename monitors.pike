/* Peace treaty analysis

A peace treaty found in game.log begins with a date, eg "20 November 1445".
If this was the final peace treaty (between war leaders), then data->previous_war will contain an entry
that has its final history block carrying the same date ("1445.11.20").
If it's a separate peace and the war is still ongoing in the current savefile, then data->active_war
will contain an entry with a history block for the same date, stating that the attacker or defender
was removed from the war.
If it was a separate peace, but the entire war has closed out before the savefile happened, then the
same war entry will be in data->previous_war.

To check:
1) In a non-final history entry, is it possible to get rem_attacker and rem_defender with the same date? It
   would require a separate peace each direction while the game is paused. Get Stephen to help test.
   (To test, declare war on each other, both with allies. Drag out the war, don't accept any peace terms,
   until allies on both sides are willing to white peace. White peace one ally out. Can the *opposite* war
   leader send a peace treaty? The same one can't. Keep war going until next save, or just save immediately.)
   - Yes. It is absolutely possible to send peace treaties both directions on the same day. They show up in
     the file as separate blocks with the same key, which the parser will combine. You can't get two blocks
     with rem_attacker or two with rem_defender, but you CAN have one of each getting merged.
2) When a country is annexed, does their entry remain, with the same country_name visible? We get tags in the
   save file, but names in the summary ("Yas have accepted peace with Hormuz").
3) Does a country always have a truce entry for that war? Check odd edge cases. Normally, if rem_attacker,
   look for original_defender, and vice versa; self->active_relations[original_other] should have entries.
4) What is last_war_status?
