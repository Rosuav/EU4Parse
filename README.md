Europa Universalis IV savefile parser
=====================================

Keep an eye on the state of the game, at least as frequently as your
autosaves happen. Any non-ironman save file should be able to be read
by this script; if you're playing ironman, you probably shouldn't be\
using this sort of tool anyway!

Mods are supported and recognized but may cause issues. Please file
bug reports if you find problems.

Both compressed and uncompressed save files can be read.

The information can best be viewed using a web browser; the default
port is 8087 but this can be changed. A TELNET interface is also
available if desired.

TODO: Document the key sender and consequent "go to province" feature.
