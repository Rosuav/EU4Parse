Need to show how many merchants (other than you) are transferring on this path.
- For each country, if them->type == "1", and if them->steer_power == us->steer_power, add 1. Exclude self.
- Show value from ({.05, .025, .016, .012, .01, .0})[count]. Infinite zeroes after the array. ==> steer_bonus_power
- Note that this is not being increased by your trade steering bonus, which is affected by
  naval tradition. The actual bonus would be a bit higher than this, usually. It's hard to
  figure the exact bonus, though, since you may be inserted somewhere in the list (due to
  tag order), and the steering bonuses of all nations past you will be recalculated. But
  it'll be roughly this value.
- From downstream, calculate the current merchant bonus
  - Find the appropriate incoming[] entry
    - They have a inc->from value - probably index into definitions
  - inc->add / (inc->value - inc->add) ==> current_steer_bonus
  - Or look at upstream's node and check its outgoing amount.
- predicted_steer_bonus is current_steer_bonus if already transferring *to this node*.
- Otherwise, add steer_bonus_power.

Transfer Trade Power will increase the value of the downstream node by:
- steer_amount * predicted_steer_bonus + inc->value*(predicted_steer_bonus - current_steer_bonus)

The financial benefit of Transfer Trade Power is the increased value of the downstream node
multiplied by the fraction that you collect. It should be possible to calculate this fraction
recursively; your home node and anywhere you collect grant collection_amount/total_value
(or collection_power/(collection_power + foreign_power)), and transfers multiply the downstream
collection fraction by the fraction transferred downstream.

SPECIAL CASE: If you are not collecting *anywhere* except your home node (with or without a home
merchant), you receive a 10% trade power bonus in your home node for each transferring merchant.
This isn't just those transferring directly to the home node - it's every merchant you have. This
could be HUGE on a big nation!

Trade Policy is a DLC feature (Cradle). Check if DLC disabled - is policy always null?
- Might not matter, since the effect of trade policy is incorporated into max_demand and val

us->prev == "Transfers from traders downstream". It's 20% of provincial trade power, as
long as you have at least 10.
